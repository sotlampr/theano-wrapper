# theano-wrapper
*Neural network library based on theano*

## Goal
The goal of this project is to cover all the material of the official [Theano deep learning tutorial](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/)
and implement the appropriate classes and functions in Python 3.

## Requirements

**[numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy), [theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano)** for computations

**[nose](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/), [coverage](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage)** for testing

**[scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)** for some helpful utilities
